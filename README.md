## Overview
Space Program for Object Tracking (SPOT) is a research-oriented application designed to monitor, analyze, and evaluate near-Earth objects (NEOs), including asteroids and other celestial bodies that may pose a potential threat to our planet.  
The project leverages NASA's open APIs to provide updated orbital data and risk assessment models, allowing users to track upcoming space objects and evaluate their impact probabilities.

## Objectives
- Collect data on asteroids and near-Earth objects through NASA's APIs.  
- Process and organize orbital information for analysis.  
- Identify upcoming objects that approach Earth.  
- Calculate potential risks associated with detected objects.  
- Provide a structured foundation for research purposes.  

## Data Sources
This project uses publicly available data provided by [NASA Open APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/), in particular:  
- **NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service)** for asteroid and orbit information.  
- **DONKI** for space weather and event tracking (optional for extended analysis).
